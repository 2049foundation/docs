# Welcome to HStreamDB

## What is HStreamDB?

HStreamDB is a streaming database built for streaming data storage and real time streaming processing.

## Why use HStreamDB?

Nowadays data is constantly being generated from different sources,
e.g. sensor data from the IoT, user click events on the Internet, etc...
We want to build low-latency applications 
that respond quickly to these incoming streaming data to deliver
better user experience, real-time data insights and timely business decisions.

But currently building such stream processing applications is not easy,
you always need to combine multiple independent components to 
construct a basic stream processing architecture.
For example, you need at least 
a streaming data capture subsystem,
a message/event storage component,
a stream processing engine,
and multiple derived data systems for different query needs.

Obviously all of this shouldn't be so complicated, 
which is why HStreamDB comes into play. 
Just as you can easily build a simple CRUD application based on a traditional database, 
with HStreamDB you can easily build a basic streaming application without any other dependencies.
